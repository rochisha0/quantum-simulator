# Quantum Circuit Simulator

This is a simple drag-and-drop quantum circuit simulator built using React. It allows users to construct quantum circuits by dragging and dropping gates onto qubits, simulate the circuit, and visualize the output statevector.

## Features

- Drag-and-drop interface for adding gates (Hadamard, Pauli-X, Pauli-Z) to the circuit
- Simulation of the quantum circuit to compute the output statevector
- Option to clear the circuit and reset the output statevector

## Usage

To use the Quantum Circuit Simulator:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone`.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install dependencies by running `npm install`.
4. Start the development server by running `npm start`.
5. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to access the simulator.
